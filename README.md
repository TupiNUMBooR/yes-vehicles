# A Rimworld mod "Yes,Vehicles"

[![Steam b18](https://img.shields.io/badge/Steam-Yes,Vehicles_b18-brightgreen.svg)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1395815101)

A true implementation of vehicles into RimWorld!

Requires [![GitHub JecsTools](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-JecsTools-blue.svg)](https://github.com/jecrell/JecsTools)

It is not my mod, i just adopted it for **b18** and tried to adopt for **b19** and **1.0**.
I don't think i will finish adopting it, so any help appreciated.

Mod files are in src folder. Copying all this repo to `RimWorld/mods` will not work, you should instead copy and rename `src` folder.
A few more complicated, but better way is using Apache Ant. It allows have folder `.git` in project without having it in `RimWorld/mods`.
